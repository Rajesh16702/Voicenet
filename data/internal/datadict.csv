column ,data-type,description
meanfreq,real,meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz). How frequent the waves are in audio  
sd,real,sd: standard deviation of frequency. What is the frequency in 1 s.d as frequency will vary throughout the audio.
median,real,median: median frequency (in kHz). Mean of the frequency
Q25,real,Q25: first quantile (in kHz). In 25% data what was the maximum frequency
Q75,real,Q75: third quantile (in kHz). In 75% of data what was the maximum value of frequency.
IQR,real,IQR: interquantile range (in kHz). It is the range between Q25 and Q75
skew,real,"skew: skewness (see note in specprop description). It reprsents the shape of graph. If S<0 It means left skewness, S=0 means symmetric, S>0 means right skewness"
kurt,real,"kurt: kurtosis (see note in specprop description). It is the description of tail, It used to determine the extreme values. Lower kurtosis is good."
sp.ent,real,sp.ent: spectral entropy. For  noisy signal it will tend to 1 and for putre signal it will tend towards 0.
sfm,real,sfm: spectral flatness measure. For noisy signal it will tend to 1 and for putre signal it will tend towards 0.
mode,real,mode: mode frequency. Dominant frequency
centroid,real,centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop). It is the multiplication of frequency and relative amplitude for ith frequency.
peakf,real,peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy). 
meanfun,real,meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
minfun,real,minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
maxfun,real,maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
meandom,real,meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
mindom,real,mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
maxdom,real,maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
dfrange,real,dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
modindx,real,modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range
label,string,label: male or female
