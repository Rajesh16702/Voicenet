If you are simply looking to start working with the voicenetG codebase, navigate to the GitHub "issues" tab and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under Docs and good first issue where you could start out.

You can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions.

Or maybe through using voicenetG you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking ‘this can be improved’. You can do something about it!
